# Technical Questions

<b>How to Prepare</b>

1. Try to solve the problem on your own. When you're solving a problem, make sure to think about the space and time efficiency
2. Write the code on paper.
3. Test your code, general cases, base cases, error cases, and so on.
4. Type your paper code as-is into a computer. You will make a bunch of mistakes, start a list of all the errors you make, so you can keep that in mind.

## What you need to know</b>

## Walking Through a Problem

1. Listen
	- Pay close attention to any information in the description
2. Example
	- Debug your example
3. Brute Force
	- First, brute force the question. Don't worry about anything else
4. Optimize
	- Walk through your brute force with optimization
	- Make a time vs space tradeoff
5. Walk Through
	- Walk through your approach in detail, ensure to understand details
6. Implement
	- Write beautiful code
7. Test
	- Conceptual test
	- Hot spots, arithmetic and null nodes
	- small test cases
	- Special test cases and edge cases
